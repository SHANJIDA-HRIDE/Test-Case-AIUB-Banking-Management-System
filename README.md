# AIUB Banking Management System

## Problem
The existing payment system that AIUB follows is dependent and not personal. Students do their semester payment or other payments throw some selected commercial banks as Dhaka Bank or Madhumati Bank etc. Most of the time after completing the registration for the upcoming semester the payment slot comes during the semester break when more than 70% of students stay with their family in their hometowns. In addition, most of the theme’s hometowns are far from Dhaka. Therefore, this is difficult for the students will go back to Dhaka only because of completing their payments and coming back home. On the other hand, if some students live in Dhaka then also they have to go to the university or nearest banks and if they go to the university or banks, they have to stand and wait in the queue, which is also time consuming. Every semester students face various kinds of problems due to this payment system. If there is the system of AIUB ATM banking service, then students can make their payment by sitting g home and going nowhere.

## Existing Solution
In the existing system, Students can pay their tuition fees from any branch of Dhaka Bank. But this process is done manually. Employees also receive their payments from various bank accounts and also deposit their money in various bank. Everything has to be done manually. The maximum process done manually for the system and the various ways involved to do the specific tasks mean that this system is not centralized and digital. There are some solutions for this project. We will try to mention it below:-
 In the modern era, we prefer online system most which seems to be easy and flexible for all of us. And also this system is centralized so that user of this system easily done their specific task like transactions. We are trying to build up such a system that can successfully do any type othe f transaction by successfully log in to the system.
Our system deals with existing problems and it gives quite quite complex free solution. Users can easily interact with the system. And get a better solution. So, it is quite easier for users to use this system efficiently and it is seems to be quite a better solution for user.   

## Our Proposal
Some problems can be handled by the existing solution. But still, there are many lacking issues that do exist while user do their transaction. Our proposed solution will help people to done their transactions easily. Our proposed system is an online banking management system software project that will serve the functionality of the banking system. The system will allow users to log in. The project will provide most of the basic functionality required for the banking system. It will allow the user to deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money to another bank account. User can make their payment online, and they use a banking card to withdraw money. The system ensures all essential components about banking.
